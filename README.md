# cafe-CLI
-is a simple utility, which I will graciously call a repo-manager (name obtained from AI **:3**), that allows you to grab sources that have PKGBUILDs from branches in a github repo and automatically install them using Pacman and make. 
The default repo is "``https://github.com/archlinux/aur``", as it is intended to be used only on archlinux to easily pull packages from the mirror repo ("``https://github.com/archlinux/aur``") and install them, but you can specify the desired repo during execution. 
It uses the AUR/pacman for dependency managing. 
Honestly it has little use outside of very specific use-cases.

To use it, simply download the "cafe.sh" file, run "chmod +x path/to/cafe" to make it an executable, and then run the following in the terminal: "path/to/cafe -h".

I haven't fully tested it yet, I've only done some general experimentation so I cannot fully speak on it's integrity or effect on your system, but it should generally run just fine.

I might add more features over time, but don't expect many/big changes to it's functionality
